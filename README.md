# Lux Plugins

汐影插件商店

This repository contains the plugin source code. A push to `main` starts
`.github/workflows/release.yml`, which compares `plugins.json` with the previous revision and only
packages and publishes plugins that were added or whose version changed. Bump a plugin's catalog
version when its source or manifest should be published; source-only merges leave existing Releases
and `index.json` untouched. The workflow builds on both `linux-x86_64` and `linux-aarch64` matching
GitHub-hosted runners and merges changed plugin entries into `index.json`, preserving unchanged
entries. Each plugin owns a stable Release whose tag is its plugin ID; versioned assets are
append-only. Re-running a release with identical indexed package bytes is a no-op, while different
bytes for an already-published asset fail and require a version bump instead of overwriting it.
Removing a plugin ID drops it from the active catalog but does not delete its historical Release or
assets. Lux validates the ZIP and its manifest before installing it into `/config/plugins`.

The package asset name includes the plugin version and target architecture, for example
`org.lux.tmdb-0.1.12-linux-x86_64.zip` and `org.lux.tmdb-0.1.12-linux-aarch64.zip`. The Lux host
selects the matching package from `packages` and stores it under its own canonical plugin ZIP
name after downloading it.

Do not commit credentials, local configuration, media data, or unreviewed executable packages.

## Emby 迁移助手

`org.lux.emby-migration` implements the one-way Lux migration contract. It connects to an administrator-approved
Emby base URL using a request-scoped API key, returns bounded user, item-state, and user-level Person favorite pages, and performs one-time
user-password verification for accounts created by Lux. It never reads an Emby database, returns an Emby access token,
or implements reverse migration. The current plugin reports `ITEM_STATE`; it does not synthesize a playback history
timeline from aggregate UserData. When the host supplies `supportsFilteredReads` projections, it limits user IDs, user fields,
state fields, and source library IDs before issuing Emby requests; legacy requests retain their previous complete-read behavior.

## Douban metadata

`org.lux.douban` (provider key `douban`) implements the Lux v1 metadata RPC contract for Douban. It supports Movie and
Series search, metadata bundles, poster images, cast/director credits, the Douban provider ID,
and available trailers. Season metadata is supported when the upstream subject represents a
season; episode, person, and collection metadata are reported as unsupported because the
referenced Douban mobile API does not expose a stable equivalent.

Search uses Douban's public subject-suggest endpoint. Details and richer metadata use the
WeChat-compatible client with the public client credential shipped by the upstream Jellyfin
Douban plugin. No credential configuration is required; the plugin is usable immediately after
installation. The optional `requestIntervalMs` setting only tunes request pacing. For private
testing or a future credential rotation, environment variables can override the built-in client
key without changing the package. Credentials are never included in RPC results or logs. The
plugin applies a bounded response size, HTTPS endpoint validation, rate limiting, retries for
timeouts/429/5xx, and a short-lived bounded response cache. Setting `LUX_DOUBAN_API_BASE_URL` to
the legacy `https://api.douban.com/v2/` endpoint selects the request shape used by the inspected
Emby DLL; the default remains the currently supported WeChat-compatible endpoint.

## Intro/outro detector

`org.lux.intro-outro-detector` implements the Lux v1 `chapter_detector` contract. It receives only
bounded raw Chromaprint point sequences selected by Lux for at least two episodes in one season.
Its manifest declares `supportedMediaSourceKinds: ["LOCAL_FILE"]`; this declaration controls which
host media sources become candidates and does not expose paths to the plugin.
Each Base64 payload is a little-endian sequence of `uint32` fingerprint points; one point represents
`1,238,095` ticks. The detector compares aligned points with a bounded Hamming-distance tolerance,
requires a non-trivial shared sequence, and uses support across the available episodes before
emitting a candidate. It does not invoke ffmpeg, access media paths, open network connections, or
receive source IDs and URLs. It returns only `IntroStart`, `IntroEnd`, and `CreditsStart` candidates;
Lux remains responsible for time-range validation, confidence filtering, persistence, and
Emby-compatible chapter output.

## TheIntroDB online chapter source

`org.lux.theintrodb-chapter-source` is an independent online chapter source. It queries
[TheIntroDB](https://theintrodb.org/) using stored TMDb, TVDb, or IMDb metadata, season/episode numbers,
and optional runtime. It receives no media path, URL, audio fingerprint, or task object, and never runs
ffmpeg or ffprobe. Its manifest declares `supportedMediaSourceKinds: ["LOCAL_FILE", "STRM_URL"]`;
the host uses that declaration to include local and `.strm` entries without sending either path or URL.
Empty upstream results preserve existing chapters. Its exact boundary and configuration
are documented in `README-theintrodb.md`.

## Webhook 通知器

`org.lux.webhook` implements the Lux v1 `notification.send` contract. Lux supplies the
provider-neutral event, including the unified `source`, `title`, `content`, `body`, and
`timestamp` fields; the plugin validates the destination again, resolves all DNS addresses,
blocks redirects and sends an HMAC-SHA256 signed JSON request. Its `payloadFormat` setting only
selects the outer Lux-native or limited Emby-style transport shape; it does not generate or
rewrite notification text. The target URL may reference Lux-generated fields with URL encoding.
Delivery queues, retry scheduling and secret storage remain owned by Lux, so this plugin has no
access to the Lux configuration directory or database.
